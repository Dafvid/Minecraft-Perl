This is a collection of perl libraries that can be used to read, write
and manipulate data files from the game Minecraft (see http://minecraft.net).

Currently, the dependencies are as follows (I probably forgot some):
PerlIO::gzip
Mouse
Perl 5.9 (due to how I'm using pack/unpack)

Right now this project is quite incomplete and usage may change as it's
developed more.  However, you can currently read/write NBT files and mess
with map chunks a bit.  I've successfully modified both the level.dat
and chunk files.

If you have any issues, questions, or contributions, please email Kevin Bosak at
kevin@bosak.net.
